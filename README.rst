Spectral Exterior Calculus
===========================

The Python module Spexy is the reference implementation of *spectral exterior calculus*. It provides a number of classes for differential forms, both in their discrete and continuous representations, with all of the associated geometric operators implemented as methods and attributes to those classes. Additionally, classes are provided for periodic and bounded grids that discretize the abstract surfaces on which the aforementioned forms reside.
